I have been using a Node 804 for my TrueNAS server for years but I needed a new case. The 804 is great but I needed something smaller that could be shoved in an IKEA Besta cabinet.
In addition to the drive trays making me nervous as I do not want to carry 4 drives just to replace one.

I actually bought a 3D printer and started learning CAD just for that. It's my first serious design.

Requirements:
 * Shallow as I neither have a rack nor the space for one.
 * Can be printed via my Qidi Q1 Pro
 * Can fit 6-8 drives
 * Can fit my HBA and an optional GPU
 * Can fit my mATX motherboard and ATX PSU
 * Easy access for hard drives
 * Drives are positioned so that the first 8 drives will clear out the PCIE zone.
 * No glue and no threaded inserts.

Dimensions: 430mm width, 375mm depth, 176.5mm height

BOM:
3 rolls of filament. Mine is around 1.8KG without any of the front drive holders.
86 x M2 10mm counterbore screws
86 x M2 hex nuts
51 x M3 10mm countersink screws
51 x M3 hex nuts
28 6x3 circular magnets
M3 motherboard standoffs + M3 nuts (Read below).
16mm PC power switch

For each fan hinge:
2 x M3 screws and 2 M3 nuts (to attach hinge 2 parts together).
4 x M3 screws and 4 M3 nuts (to attach each hinge to 4 hdd holders).
4 magnets
4 x M3 screws and 4 M3 nuts (to attach to the hdd holder).
2 x M2.5 22mm counterbore screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts
2 x 30mm screws and corresponding nuts.

For each HDD holder:
2 x M2.5 18mm counterbore screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts for attaching the connector
1 x SFF-8482 SAS Female to SATA Male 90 degrees connector https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008077051668.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.75.d85f18023sqB9C

For each SSD holder:
up to 3 x SFF-8482 SAS to SATA 3.0 Adapter (SATA Male to Female) `https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005773620960.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.124.d85f18023sqB9C
2 x M2.5 30mm counterbore screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts for the connectors.
3 x M2.5 18mm counterbore screws and 3 x 2.5M nuts, 1 x M2 10mm counterbore screws and 1 x M2 nut for connecting all the body pieces (Shorter screws will do).

For each side SSD holder:
2 x M2.5 18mm counterbore screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts for attaching the connector AND THE STRUCTURE TO LEFT WALL.
1 x SFF-8482 SAS to SATA 3.0 Adapter (SATA Male to Female) `https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005773620960.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.124.d85f18023sqB9C

M2.5 counterbore screws, washers and nuts for attaching studs, HDD and SSD holders to the case (Amount depends on the number of drives used. read below).

Printing:
I used a Qidi Q1 Pro for printing. My nozzle is 0.4 and the layer height is 0.2.
I am using Orca slicer
I had to use a glue stick otherwise prints won't release (mesh would break instead of release).
I did not want to print with support thus some parts got split insanely (The intact versions are there).
Please make sure your printer is as accurate as possible. There is not much wiggle room.
I used a mix of black and white Elegoo rapid PETG and Sunlu white PETG.
The case seems to be a bit wider at the front. Probably due to warping but the front top should bring it together nicely.

Assembly:
Instructions assume the case is oriented so that front wall is towards us.

- Bottom:
 - I planned pockets for screw heads but it was easier to use them for the nuts.
 - Bolt middle left and middle right with 3 x M2 screws and 3 x M2 nuts
 - Bolt rear left and rear right with 5 x M2 screws and 5 x M2 nuts
 - Bolt rear and middle with 12 x M2 screws and 12 x M2 nuts
 - Install the 6 magnets in the corresponding pockets in middle part

- Rear wall
 - Bolt rear PSU to the bottom using 3 x M2 screws and 3 x M2 nuts
 - Bolt rear middle to the bottom using 3 x M2 screws and 3 x M2 nuts. There are 5 holes but only 3 are usable. I might fix that in a future iteration depending on how stable the structure is.
 - Bolt rear PCI to the bottom using 4 x M2 screws and 4 x M2 nuts

- Right wall
 - Bolt rear part to the bottom using 4 x M2 screws and 4 x M2 nuts
 - Bolt front part to the bottom using 4 x M2 screws and 4 x M2 nuts

- Left wall
 - Bolt rear part to the bottom using 4 x M2 screws and 4 x M2 nuts
 - Bolt front part to the bottom using 4 x M2 screws and 4 x M2 nuts
 - Bolt front left support to the left wall using 3 x M2 screws and 3 x M2 nuts

- Front wall
 - The power button holder:
  - attached to the left wall using 3 x M2 screws and 3 x M2 nuts.
  - attached to the bottom using 1 x M2 screws and 1 x M2 nuts.
 - mesh parts and bottom front bolted together
 - Attach bottom front
  - Install 6 magnets into the pockets.
  - Bolt it using 6 x M2 screws and 6 x M2 nuts
  - Orient it so that magnets are towards the front wall and the thick part is towards the bottom.
 - 2 front supports. Each takes a magnet and 6 x M2 screws and 6 x M2 nuts.

- Bolt left wall to PCIE cutouts part using 3 x M3 screws and nuts
- Bolt PCIE cutouts part to middle part using 4 x M3 screws and nuts
- Bolt middle part to PSU part using 4 x M3 screws and nuts
- Bolt PCIE top part to middle part using 4 x M3 screws and nuts
- Corner support between rear wall and right/left walls:
 - The thin part with the hole is oriented upwards.
 - Use 6x3mm circular magnet for each
 - Use 2 x M3 screws and 2 x M3 nuts for each

- Side supports:
 - 2 side supports
 - Each takes 2 magnets
 - Each needs 8 x M3 screws and 8 x M3 nuts

- Top
 - Front parts to be connected using front top support.
  - Each top support needs 6 x M2 screws and 6 x M2 nuts.
  - Each top support needs a magnet. Make sure the orientation is correct w.r.t front support magnets.
  - 2 Magnets for front rear. Use 2 x M3 screws and 2 x M3 nuts for each.
 - Rear parts to be screwed using 4 x M3 screws and 4 x M3 nuts.
  - 4 Magnets for the rear part. Use 2 x M3 screws and 2 x M3 nuts for each.

- Motherboard standoffs
 - The case supports both ATX and mATX motherboards. You can still use mini ITX if you want.
 - ATX-only locations are labeled "A"
 - mATX-only locations are labeled "M"
 - NOTE: Not all motherboards will have holes for all standoffs. Please check before screwing your notherboard
 - Standoffs:
  - My standoffs have 6mm threads and are 6mm in height. They however are too short. The motherboard will not even reach the IO cutout.
  - I had to stack standoffs to raise the motherboard. If someone has 9-10mm long standoffs then please comment if they work.
  - I could redesign the motherboard cutout part to accommodate the shorter standoffs but it might have issues with PCIE cards and I already wasted 2 filament rolls. Maybe I will investigate in a future update.

- PCIE covers
 - Print as much as you need.
 - They just snap into place from the outside.

- SSD side holder:
 - Attach to the left wall using 2 x M2.5 screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts.
 - The thick holder wall is towards the side wall.
 - Make sure the connector is oriented correctly otherwise the SSD will not fit.

- SSD holder:
 - It will easily come together using the M2.5 screws.
 - Join the body pieces together with the M2 and M2.5 screws and nuts.

- HDD holder:
 - Attach the connector using 2 x M2.5 screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts.

- HDD fan hinge:
 - I changed the design to remove the rear screw holes and forgot to take new pics before screwing in the fans
 - Use 2 x M3 screws and 2 M3 nuts to attach both parts of hinge 2.
 - Install the magnets
 - Connect both hinge parts using 2 x M2.5 22mm counterbore screws and 2 x 2.5M nuts
 - Each fan hinge attaches to 4 hdd holders using 4 x M3 screws and 4 M3 nuts
 - I recommend attaching the hinge to the holders after they are installed and afterwards attach the fan.

- Drive studs and holders:
 - I used a 1mm thick rubber strip hoping it will help with HDD vibrations. No idea if it does.
 - Make sure to attach all SATA data and power cables before screwing in the holders.
 - The space is very tight. I used SilverStone SST-CP06-E4 cables. They are short and flexible.
 - The case can host up to 12 holders.
 - The large stud is at the front. The small stud is towards the back.
 - Make sure the large stud is oriented correctly: There are tiny pockets that go above the magnets pockets
 - Screw in studs first. For each position:
  - If it will be empty, use 3 x M2.5 14mm screws
  - If it will host an SSD holder, use 1 x M2.5 14mm screw for the furthest hole in the large stud.
  - If it will host an HDD holder, use 1 x M2.5 14mm screw for the small stud.
 - Holders screw on top of the already screwed studs.
 - For the holders:
  - HDD: Use 2 x M2.5 25mm screws, a washer and 2 nuts.
  - SSD: Use 2 x M2.5 16mm screws and 2 nuts.             

- Bottom plates:
 - Attach using 3 x M2 screws and 3 x M2 nuts (Even 2 will do).
 - There are holes for 4 screws but the 4th is inaccessible.

- Fans:
 - Use the 30mm screws.
 - I used M2.5 with a washer to prevent the screw head from going through the hole :D

- Attach the power button to its holder.

TODO:
rear middle has 5 screw holes but bottom has 4 pockets only.
rear middle 1 screw has no place for the bolt. too tight.
bottom plates, 1 screw is inaccessible and screws are too difficult
motherboard standoff heights
bottom is too difficult to assemble
I don't like top front.
front wall is flimsy.
hinges are too flimsy. I don't like it :/
hinge bottom opening to pass fan cable.
